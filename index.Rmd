Hello!

I am Xiyu Chen currently a sceond year Master of Data Science student at Georgetown University. I am seeking for a full time job in data scientist right now. 

This is my website of my data visualization works. So this website mainly consists the work I did on drawing graphs in R. I am also interested in other areas of data science. 

This website mainly contains my course works. You can go through my project that is about soccer around the world and tweets of the soccer clubs. Also, my homeworks, those contain a wide range of graphs, geospatial, networks and a lot.

If you are interested in my other works, you can go to my github. I am interested in a lot of things from Unity small games, reinforcement learning, deep learning to NLP.
